# IgFollowersAnalyzer
This project contains the script for seeing the people you follow that doesnt follow you back or vice versa. All one needs to do to be able to use this is to go to Settings -> Accounts Center -> 
Your information and permissions -> Export your information on instagram. From there an export should be created with the following/followers informations selected. Once instagram verifies your export 
request the zip file should be downloaded from the same screen and then the extracted folders path should be provided to the DATA_PATH variable in the code. The code is good to go after that and the results 
of the comparison will be in a txt file named followers_comparison.txt in the same data path.
